## MLOps Engineer | Scaling ML Models in Production

I'm passionate about bridging the gap between Data Science and Operations, making ML models work reliably at scale. With 4+ years in DevOps, I've transitioned to MLOps where I help organizations deploy models that serve millions without breaking a sweat.

### ðŸš€ What I Do

- **Build Production ML Systems**: Deploy models handling 50M+ daily predictions with 99.9% uptime
- **Optimize Infrastructure**: Reduce costs by 40% while improving performance
- **Automate Everything**: From data pipelines to model monitoring and retraining
- **Ensure Reliability**: Because ML in production should be boring - it just works!

### ðŸ’¼ Professional Impact

```python
impact = {
    "predictions_served_daily": "50M+",
    "system_uptime": "99.9%",
    "response_time": "<100ms",
    "cost_savings": "$3.2M annually",
    "fraud_prevented": "$2.3M in 6 months",
    "automation_rate": "75% of DevOps tasks"
}
